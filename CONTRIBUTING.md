# Contributing
If you want to contribute to the project and make it better, your help is very welcome.

### Submitting an issue
Please submit an issue if you want to report a bug or propose new features.

### Installing/Developing
To install the toolchain (ideally into a virtualenv) just run the setup.py script with the install parameter. It will install your application into the virtualenv site-packages folder and also download and install all dependencies:
```
python setup.py install
```

If you are developing on the toolchain and also want the requirements to be installed, you can use the develop command instead:
```
python setup.py develop
```
This has the advantage of just installing a link to the site-packages folder instead of copying the data over. You can then continue to work on the code without having to run install again after each change.

### Generating documentation
Documentation is automatically generated by GitLab CI/CD when a commit is pushed to the repository.  

However, if you want to generate it offline, you may go to the `docs` directory and execute `make html` from there.  
This will generate a `build/html` directory with the generated documentation.

This built documentation won't be uploaded to the repository with any commit, since it is being ignored by git, and it should keep like that.
