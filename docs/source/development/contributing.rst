If you want to contribute to the project and make it better, your help is very welcome.

Installation for developers
===========================

To install the toolchain (ideally into a virtualenv) just run the setup.py script with the install parameter. It will install Tasho into the virtualenv site-packages folder and also download and install all dependencies:

   .. code:: bash

       python setup.py install

If you are developing on the toolchain and also want the requirements to be installed, you can use the develop command instead:

   .. code:: bash

       python setup.py develop

This has the advantage of just installing a link to the site-packages folder instead of copying the data over. You can then continue to work on the code without having to run install again after each change.


Documenting your code
=====================
Documentation is automatically generated by GitLab CI/CD when a commit is pushed to the repository.

However, if you want to generate it offline, you may go to the `docs` directory and execute ``make html`` from there.
This will generate a ``build/html`` directory with the generated documentation.

This built documentation won't be uploaded to the repository with any commit, since it is being ignored by git, and it should keep like that.
