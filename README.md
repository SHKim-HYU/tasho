# TASHO

### Develop
If you are actively developing this package, it is recommended to "install" it in a virtual environment using `python setup.py develop` in the project root.
This has the advantage of just installing a link to the site-packages folder instead of copying the data over. You can then continue to work on the code without having to run install again after each change.
